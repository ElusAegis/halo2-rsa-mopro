# Sample Halo2 Mopro Integration Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Halo2 adapter into a Rust project for building libraries with Halo2 proofs.

## Building the Project

Make sure you have the pre-requisites installed. You can find the instructions [here](https://zkmopro.org/docs/docs/prerequisites).

After that, you can clone the repo and run `cargo build` or `cargo test`.

## Integrating with IOS/Android

Please refer to the [Mopro documentation](https://zkmopro.org/docs) for more information on how to integrate the library with IOS and Android.
